          <p>Content will be customized to your needs, the time limit, and the audience.<br><br>

        If you have a piano, my spicy wife with come and accompany me.<br><br>
        If you ask really nicely, she might be willing to speak about what it is like to be married to someone with washboard ribs.<br><br>
        And I guess if you just want my wife to speak that is also an option. But only if cheesecake is provided.<br><br><br>

        I live in Bluffdale, UT. As long as you live within a reasonable distance I will come and speak for free!<br><br>
        *Venue must be wheelchair accessible. This stipulation seems obvious, but some people forget. We do have ramps that can conquer a single stair that is less than 8" tall.<br></p>

        <p>Yes, this meme was included entirely because it included a wheelchair pun.</p>
